🚦 Saarthi: Traffic Data Analysis

This project is built as part of our team assignment "Saarthi", where we focused on analyzing and visualizing traffic data.
The goal was to make traffic-related data easier to understand using tabular representation and graphs.

📌 Features

Data Upload: Upload traffic data in CSV format.

Tabular View: See the raw data neatly in a table.

Visualization: Generate different graphs (bar, line, pie, etc.) to analyze accidents, weather, and traffic flow.

Separation of Concerns:

Backend (Python + Flask) handles the logic and visualization.

Frontend (HTML + CSS) shows the results in a simple UI.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML+CSS

Backend: Python+Flask+Panda+Matplotlib

📊 Example Outputs

Tabular Data – displays rows of traffic info.

Graphs – accident hotspots, vehicle count trends, weather impact, etc.

👥 Team Saarthi

Worked together as beginners in data visualization & web development.
